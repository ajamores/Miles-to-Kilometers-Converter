Learning GUI Application Development with Tkinter

This repository contains the code for a simple GUI application developed using the Tkinter library in 
Python. The project was developed as a part of my learning journey in GUI application development.

Overview

The project is a simple application that converts miles to kilometers. The user inputs the number 
of miles, and the program calculates the equivalent distance in kilometers. The user interface is 
developed using Tkinter, and the conversion is performed using Python.

Learning Journey

As someone who had prior experience in developing GUI applications using JavaFX, I found the process 
of learning Tkinter to be quite similar. The core concepts such as layouts, widgets, and event 
handling were very similar to those in JavaFX, and I was able to apply my previous knowledge to 
this project.

Throughout the development process, I made a conscious effort to document my learning and thought 
process by adding comments and notes in the code. This made it easier for me to refer back to my 
previous work and understand the reasoning behind certain design decisions.

Conclusion

Overall, this project was a great learning experience in GUI application development using Tkinter. 
Through the process, I was able to apply my previous knowledge in JavaFX and gain a better 
understanding of the core concepts of GUI application development.
